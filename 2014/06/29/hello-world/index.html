<p><strong>Hello World!</strong>  I find it fitting that my first entry here would start with “Hello World”, since Hello World is usually<br>the first programming example of choice, and well most these posts will be centered around programming and technology.</p>
<p>I’ve had this desire to put together this website for quite sometime now, and i’ve finally decided to put a stake in the ground and make time to do it.  I hope to showcase myself as a professional but more importantly, I hope this site can serve as a resource for other professionals, and hobbyists alike.</p>
<p>The first set of posts will detail my journey around building MichaelArnel.com, going over in detail which tools I used and<br>and how, the options I explored, and ultimately why I settled on the path I chose.</p>
<p>Today there are so many options available to someone that wants to publish a website on the web, in the end you can boil it down to 3 considerations:</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Required</span> <span class="constant">Toolsets</span>.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Budget</span>.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Skill</span> set of person building <span class="keyword">and</span>/<span class="keyword">or</span> maintaining.</span>
</code></pre><p>When I first sat down to start planning how I was going to build MichaelArnel.com, I wanted to be able to showcase all of my skills and then possibly have a sandbox to play around with emerging technologies and frameworks that would be accessible to friends and peers.  This is what I would consider the cadillac of options and could easily be achieved utilizing cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Cloud based computing services provide an array of tools and services to fit any of your needs.  With this type of service, the costs associated are typically based on a “pay for what you use” type model.  This was really appealing to me early on in my process in figuring out how I wanted to host this site.  Considering the services and capabilities I wanted to have access to, going the route of a traditional dedicated or shared hosting provider would have been very costly up front.</p>
<p>Amazon offers a free tier EC2 micro instance for the first year of service.  This is a really nice offering for this type of project and really any type of project you are trying to get off the ground.  Here’s a list of the benefits you get with the free tier:</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">EC2</span> running <span class="constant">Linux</span>/<span class="constant">Unix</span> <span class="constant">Micro</span> instance usage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">EC2</span> running <span class="constant">Microsoft</span> <span class="constant">Windows</span> <span class="constant">Server</span> <span class="constant">Micro</span> instance usage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">Elastic</span> <span class="constant">Load</span> <span class="constant">Balancing</span> plus <span class="number">15</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> data processing
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">30</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of <span class="constant">Amazon</span> <span class="constant">EBS</span> <span class="constant">Standard</span> volume storage plus <span class="number">2</span> million <span class="constant">IOs</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> snapshot storage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">15</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of bandwidth out aggregated across all <span class="constant">AWS</span> services
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of <span class="constant">Regional</span> <span class="constant">Data</span> <span class="constant">Transfer</span></span>
</code></pre><p>There are somethings you should keep in mind if taking an approach like Amazon’s free tier service.  I listed above some benefits to the free tier, but these should also be looked at as thresholds as well.  Once you start requiring more storage, bandwith, and/or additional processing power you will have moved out of the free tier level of service.  Chances are however if this is the case it means your service/product is being used and the growth is welcomed. If you wanted to play around with Amazon’s cost calculator  ( <a href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank">http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a> ) , you could estimate the expenses you would incur by using this type of service.</p>
<p>Of course there are other providers as well, you’re not just limited to using Amazon for cloud based services.  Microsoft, RackSpace, Google and others all provide comparable offerings and the space is ultra competitive at the moment so prices are reaching new lows everyday!  Feel free to explore all the other providers in your search when evaluating cloud based services for your website needs.</p>
<p>I expanded my research out to shared and dedicated hosting next.  There are some definite advantages to going this route, and some definite dis-advantages in my opinion.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Cost</span>, there are some really cheap shared hosting options out there.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Server</span> <span class="constant">Maintenance</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> backups are handled by their professional staff.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Uptime</span> reliability.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Mature</span> control panels that make managing your site a breeze.</span>
</code></pre><p>Cons:</p>
<pre><code>- Costs, this <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> a mistake, i've listed costs <span class="keyword">as</span> a pro <span class="keyword">and</span> a con.  There are <span class="keyword">some</span> dedicated options <span class="keyword">that</span> are rather costly when compared <span class="keyword">to</span> other options.
- Flexibility, your options are usually limited <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="keyword">the</span> features your web host provides. ie. Server Side tools <span class="keyword">for</span> applications.
- Your website performance could be impacted <span class="keyword">by</span> another customers resource utilization within <span class="keyword">the</span> same host.
</code></pre><p>I found most hosting providers offered a similar set of services and tools for hosting your website.  One of the nice benefits that almost hosts provide are plugins for WordPress, Joomla or Drupal.  Simply go through the Control Panel and press a few buttons and your site will be converted to chosen platform.  Using one of these platforms gives non-technical skilled individuals the ability to rapidly build their website and manage the content with little or no development skills necessary.  Another nice advantage to using one of these platforms are there are literally thousands of free or small fee templates and themes that provide professional designs without needing website design skills.</p>
<p>As I surfed around the internet exploring all my options I kept coming across this concept of a “Static Website”, and great there for specific applications.  Static websites are not alternative hosting options but more so a architectural concept for a website, which can be hosted in any of the methods already discussed.</p>
<p>What is a Static Website? Good question, it’s exactly as it sounds.  Static websites are complete websites consisting of purley static content, meaning there’s no dynamic pages being generated or content being read from a database or some other storage mechanism.  The content pages that are deployed to the server are the very same pages served to the browser.  Very interesting!  There are many questions and thoughts I had when I first started exploring this option.  The first obvious question was why???</p>
<p>Static websites are light-weight and fast!  Because the websites are static in content and require no intense server side processing or other costly server side applications like Databases, static websites can be hosted very cheaply. Static websites obviously won’t fit every need since they’re somewhat limited in nature to the static content they provide, but they are perfect solutions for informational sites, portfolios, blogs, etc.</p>
<p>This is ultimately the direction I ended up going for this website.  I had to sacrifice the server-side programming tools I wanted to use, but in the end I really just needed something snappy and cost effective, static sites where a no brainer for me!</p>
<p>In the up coming articles I’ll share the following:</p>
