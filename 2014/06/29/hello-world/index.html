<p><strong>Hello World!</strong>  I find it fitting that my first entry here would start with “Hello World”, since Hello World is usually<br>the first programming example of choice, and well most these posts will be centered around programming and technology.</p>
<p>I’ve had this desire to put together this website for quite sometime now, and i’ve finally gotten around to making it<br>happen!  I hope to showcase myself as a professional but more importantly, I hope this site can serve as a resource<br>for other professionals, and hobbyists alike.</p>
<p>The first set of posts will detail my journey in building MichaelArnel.com, going over in detail which tools I used and<br>and how, the options I explored, and ultimately why I settled on the path I chose.</p>
<p>There are so many options to consider when sitting down to build a website. These are some of the questions I had to answer when I committed mentally to building this site.</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">What</span> programming languages will you use?
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">How</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> where will it be hosted?
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">What</span> will it cost to run?
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Will</span> it run server side code, <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">require</span> database access?</span>
</code></pre><p>I’m not going to lie, when I first set off to build this website I had planned to use DurandalJS on the front-end, Node.json the back, maybe MongoDB for database storage, and then I went shopping for web host that could provide all these services.  Since this is a personal project I didn’t want to spend too much money to host the site, so I started looking at some traditional shared virtual host providers.  Most offerings where right on the money ranging from $4 - $10 dollars a month.  Unfortunately most in this price range offered the standard set of host options which include:</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Control</span> <span class="constant">Panel</span> <span class="constant">Tools</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> site management
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">PHP</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Ruby</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">MySQL</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">WordPress</span> <span class="constant">Blogging</span> <span class="constant">Tools</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Don’t get me wrong these are all great options and for that price range a steal, it just wasn’t what I personally wantedto use.  At my day job we take advantage of Amazon’s AWS services so I figured I’d take a look at whether or not it wouldit would be practical from a cost perspective.  I also looked into RackSpace and Microsoft Azure cloud services as well.There is a huge competitive market in that area right now so prices all really comparable.</p>
<p>Amazon offers a free tier EC2 micro instance for the first year of service.  This is a huge perk for this type of project and one that really enticed me.  Here’s a list of the benefits you get with the free tier:</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">EC2</span> running <span class="constant">Linux</span>/<span class="constant">Unix</span> <span class="constant">Micro</span> instance usage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">EC2</span> running <span class="constant">Microsoft</span> <span class="constant">Windows</span> <span class="constant">Server</span> <span class="constant">Micro</span> instance usage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">750</span> hours of <span class="constant">Elastic</span> <span class="constant">Load</span> <span class="constant">Balancing</span> plus <span class="number">15</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> data processing
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">30</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of <span class="constant">Amazon</span> <span class="constant">EBS</span> <span class="constant">Standard</span> volume storage plus <span class="number">2</span> million <span class="constant">IOs</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> snapshot storage
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">15</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of bandwidth out aggregated across all <span class="constant">AWS</span> services
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="constant">GB</span> of <span class="constant">Regional</span> <span class="constant">Data</span> <span class="constant">Transfer</span></span>
</code></pre><p>This sounded perfect and would allow me to configure the server has I saw fit for the needs of this project.  But how much would this cost after the year was up?  I mean we do expect and hope that our site will be around for more than a year ;-)  After reviewing the costs using the Cost Estimator provided by amazon ( <a href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank">http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a> ) it became clear that this might not be the best fit after all.  Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t that it was overly costly especially considering the flexibility you get at that cost.</p>
<p>After digging around on the web for cost effective ways to use AWS services I came across some articles on building <em>Static Sites</em> using Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) at a fraction of the cost.  While doing some research on the topic of static sites I found that Amazon’s S3 service was not the only service for cheaply hosting static sites.  There are even many ways to do this for free including hacks with web tools like DropBox or Google Drive, and even GitHub.  Wait! what??? GitHub?  Yep, that’s exactly what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>“But wait Michael, didn’t you say early on that one of your requirements was the ability to use Node.js and MongoDB on the server side?”  You’re right, that was one of my requirements when I started this process, but after doing some homework on building static sites and the cost effectiveness they provide, it was an easy decision to make.</p>
<p>In the up coming articles I’ll share the following:</p>
